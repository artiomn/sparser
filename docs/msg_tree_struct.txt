Message tree structure

Message tree consists of lists of nodes.
Every node has type: link, field or metafield.
All nodes has parent. On level 0 node->parent == NULL.
All nodes has brother. If it's last node in the list, node->next == NULL.

Linked list, generated from message, includes only fields.
Fields has metadata and pointer to data from real message.
Metafields change metadata structure or user can define metafields,
which hasn't special meaning.

Link - is a tree control node.
Link can has children list (if link hasn't childrens link->child == NULL).
In the link @endif, children always equal to NULL.

Tree example.

a     - field or metafield node.
[d]   - link node.
->    - next.
|     - parent above node or child below link node.
